Fairly positive results via Naive RAG implementation of a LOCALLY ran model of google/gemma-2b-it using huggingface transformers with python.
I passed in Powell's speech (https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20231201a.htm) as a context prompt and ran the LLM locally
for text-generation with the 2b version. I had a memory resource issue when I tried the 7b version as it terminated when it did the checkpoint sharding.
I specified max_new_tokens=512 (otherwise it defaults to 20) and set do_sample=False (for greedy searching) and low_memory=True.

These are the results :

**What are the implications for a student?**

- The unemployment rate has risen a bit, but it is still very low by historical standards.
- The Federal Reserve is committed to bringing inflation down to 2 percent over time.
- Education is a key to success, and students should invest their time and effort to gain knowledge and skills that are preparing them for successful careers.

**What has been the effect of the pandemic?**

The passage does not provide any information about the effect of the pandemic on the economy, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.

**What is the main concern here?**

A. The Federal Reserve's actions to promote a healthy economy are not effective.
B. The Federal Reserve's actions to promote a healthy economy are too restrictive.
C. The Federal Reserve's actions to promote a healthy economy are too expansionary.
D. The Federal Reserve's actions to promote a healthy economy are too slow.

**What actions did the Fed take?**

- The Fed raised its policy interest rate and decreased the size of its balance sheet.
- The Fed slowed the growth of the economy to help reduce inflation.
- The Fed is moving forward carefully, as the risks of under- and over-tightening are becoming more balanced.

Overall, quite positive results in my opinion for a naive model running on a local instance.
